SnackFall: Shiba's Basket
Development Platform: Unity (using C#)
Genre: 2D Mobile Arcade/Action Game
Concept: A charming and challenging 2D mobile game developed in Unity, where players navigate through distinct scenes (Title, Character Select, Game) to control a chosen Shiba Inu equipped with a basket. The goal is to catch delicious snacks falling from the sky, strategically avoid dangerous treats and dive-bombing birds, and manage the Shiba's speed through a variable jump and natural movement, all while having access to a persistent Options menu.
Player Goal: Achieve the highest score possible by strategically catching falling snacks, skillfully avoiding dangerous items and environmental hazards (splats, birds), and managing the Shiba's speed by utilizing a variable jump and careful avoidance of weight gain, navigating through the game's structured scenes.

Game Structure & Scene Flow:
The game is structured around three main scenes:
1. Title Scene:
   * The first scene the player encounters.
   * Displays the game title: "SnackFall: Shiba's Basket".
   * Provides the following options:
      * Start Game: Transitions to the Character Select Scene.
      * Options: Opens the persistent Options Menu overlay.
      * Exit Game: Quits the application.
2. Character Select Scene:
   * Accessed from the "Start Game" option in the Title Scene.
   * Displays the available different colored Shiba Inu characters for the player to choose from.
   * Allows the player to select their desired Shiba character (visual change only).
   * Allows the player to equip different accessories and baskets that are unlocked through gameplay.
   * Provides the following options:
      * Start Game (with Selected Character): Transitions to the Game Scene, loading the chosen Shiba.
      * Options: Opens the persistent Options Menu overlay.
      * Back (or similar): Returns to the Title Scene.
3. Game Scene:
   * Accessed from the "Start Game" option in the Character Select Scene.
   * This is where the core gameplay takes place.
   * The chosen Shiba Inu is displayed and controlled by the player.
   * Falling snacks, splats, birds, scoring, and all gameplay mechanics are active here.
   * An Options Icon (e.g., a gear or pause symbol) is persistently visible, likely in the top-right corner of the screen. Tapping this icon opens the Options Menu and pauses the game.




Persistent Options Menu:
* This menu can be accessed from the Title, Character Select, and Game scenes via the "Options" button/icon.
* When opened from the Game Scene, it pauses the game.
* Provides the following options:
   * Close Menu (or Resume Game): Closes the Options Menu overlay and, if in the Game Scene, unpauses the game.
   * Toggle Music Mute: Mutes or unmutes the game's background music.
   * Toggle Sound Effects Mute: Mutes or unmutes the game's sound effects (catching, bonking, splatting, jumping, etc.).

Gameplay Mechanics (Detailed):
1. Falling Snacks: * Various snack items fall from the top of the screen at random horizontal positions and varying speeds. * Each snack has a small parachute attached, causing it to drift and gently rock back and forth as it descends. * Difficulty increases over time with more frequent and faster snacks (visual cues like smaller parachutes or tears could signify increased speed). * Snack Types: * Standard Snacks: Grant points when caught. * Special Snacks: Can grant more points, temporary positive effects (e.g., speed boost), or temporary negative effects even if caught. * Dangerous Snacks: Immediately end the game if caught in the basket. Examples: Chocolate, Grapes, Avocado, Onion. Distinct visual appearances, and crucially, their parachutes are marked with a clear poison skull symbol and potentially a distinct color/sound.
2. Player Control: * Horizontal movement of the Shiba using designated on-screen areas/buttons for left/right. * Jumping: Tap and hold anywhere on the screen outside the movement areas. Tap duration determines jump height and distance. Releasing initiates the jump. Used to clear ground obstacles.
3. Basket Interaction: * Catching: Safe snacks in basket = points. * Catching Dangerous Snacks: In basket = Game Over. * Splatting: Snack hits ground = points penalty, leaves temporary splat obstacle.
4. Shiba Interaction (Negative Outcomes & Speed Management): * Shiba starts fast. * Speed Reduction (Catching): Slight, persistent speed decrease per snack caught (basket weight). * Weight Gain (Eating Splats): Walk over splat = small point penalty, gain weight, significant, cumulative, persistent speed debuff. Visual weight gain cue. * Weight Loss (Movement & Jumping): Gradual recovery of speed debuff from weight as Shiba moves horizontally and jumps. * Bonk (from Snacks): Snack hits head = significant point penalty, temporary severe speed debuff. Visual daze cue.
5. Bird Hazard: * Occasional dive-bombing bird threat. * Avoid bird bonk (via movement or possibly jumping). * Bird bonk = point penalty, potential temporary stun/debuff. * Bird icon on screen edges pointing to incoming bird. Bird attacks vertically,  player has to avoid left and right. Bird attacks horizontally, player has to jump to avoid.
6. Directional Indicators: * Arrows on screen edges pointing to incoming snacks. * Color changes (Green -> Yellow -> Red) indicate proximity to the ground.
7. Scoring: * Points for catching safe snacks. * Penalties for splatting, snack bonks, eating splats, and bird bonks. * Game ends on catching Dangerous Snack or reaching a negative score threshold.
8. Speed Debuff and Weight Management: * Starts fast. * Speed affected by catching (slight, persistent), eating splats (significant, cumulative, persistent), snack bonks (temporary, severe), and bird bonks (potential temporary). * Active movement and jumping mitigate speed loss from weight gain. * Skillful play focuses on avoiding weight gain and using movement/jumps to manage speed.
9. Character Selection: * Choose from different colored Shiba Inus (cosmetic) and accessories and basket.
